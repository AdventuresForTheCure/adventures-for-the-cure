      p This is an intermediate-to-fast MTB ride. There will be spirited efforts to shred the gnar, but also a few regroup points along the way. This is NOT a no drop ride. However, don't let that scare you away. The best way to get faster is to ride with faster, more skilled riders. If there are enough riders, we will do an "A" and "B" group. The route will vary from week-to-week, but will be sent out by Wednesday of each week. This allows riders to meet up along the way, or know where to go if they get dropped. The ride will move to 6PM starting May 1st.
