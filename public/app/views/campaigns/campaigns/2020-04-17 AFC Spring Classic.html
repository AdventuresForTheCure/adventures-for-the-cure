 <b class="special">Rules:</b><br/>
 <ul>
  <li>This is an unofficial event, performed at the participants individual discretion and risk.  Anyone can do these segments on their own at anytime.  This competition is an attempt to raise funds for AFC charities, provide a much needed friendly competition in trying times, and finally a chance to be declared an AFC legend!</li>
  <li>From the start of the race, participants will have 2 weeks to complete all 5 stages.  Cyling first, then 2 weeks later the running competition will commence</li>
  <li>Participants may attempt stages multiple times and, but attempts must be posted to the google sheet or sent to the race organizer the same day they are completed (no hiding results to the end and surprising everyone with your awesomeness).</li>
  <li>We're requesting a $50 donation per event.  So $100 if entering both the cycling and running event.</li>
  <li>No group efforts (We're supposed to be Social Distancing anyway).  This is especially important on the cycling  road stages 1 and 2.  If you want to ride or run with 1 or 2 others for safety reasons that is of course allowed.  If you do this, make sure to maintain good 'social distance' -no drafting.  We will look at Strava Flyby to make sure people are following the spirit of this rule.</li>
  <li>Time bonuses:  Stages 1, 2, and 4  are relatively short.  In each category the winner of these stages will get a 30 second time bonus.  I think it will provide a little extra incentive to give it everything on the short stages.  In the running competition, there will be a 30 second time bonus for the  Trolley trail prologue and Ilchester climb only.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3 class="special">Cycling Challenge Stage Details</h3> - Five Stages - 2 road, 1 “mixed surface”, and 2 mountain bike.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 1 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/856507?filter=overall&gender=all" target="_blank">Stage 1- Levering to Ilchester (road)</a><br/>
 If you've done AFC's WsW, you know this segment well.  Starts near the bridge on Levering, up Lawyers, up the false flat on Monty, then the punishing rollers of Landing road.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 2 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/3396458?filter=overall" target="_blank">Stage 2- ESC Ridge-Hanover-Race (road)</a><br/>
 This covers nearly all of the Elkridge Spring Classic road race loop (minus the 2 stop signs).  Starts with the ridge climb, making rights turns to the hanover downhill, and the rest is a TT to the end of Race road.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 3 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/22546316" target="_blank">Woodstock Gravel</a><br/>
 This is a relatively new segment, but I think it is a true gem.  Starts with the Church rd hill out of Ellicott City, then follows Park Dr into the Hollifield area of PVSP.  There is a short gravel stretch and then it is back to pavement through the campground.  Using park roads you pass under route 40 and pick up the power line access gravel road which connects you to the paved old ranger trail.  At the end of that trail you take a right on Church lane.  Follow Church lane to the 'T' intersection and take a right on Rogers Ave, then take immediate right onto Frederick road at the traffic circle after passing over I-70 bridge.  Follow Old Frederick Road for ~1km then take the left onto Daniels road.  Take the fast downhill (watch for tight curve at top of descent) into the Daniels area of PVSP.  Near the bottom (but still  ~150 meters from the parking area) bear left into the gravel road.  There is a gate blocking vehicles but there is an opening on the right side.  There is a small but simple creek crossing after which you stay to the right to pick up the trail along the river. Follow the flat path along the river all the way to the Horse Fly Alley trail.   You will know you are getting close after the second crossing of the railroad tracks after the Davis tunnel. After the second crossing of the tracks it is basically the second chance you will get to turn left.  The easiest way to pick it out is there are some dark  colored flat plates that cover a low wet area at the turn.  From there it is a climb to the finish with some small rocks.  The segment ends just before a cable that crosses the trail separating the park from a local private driveway.  I recommend riding all the way to the cable and you should get credit for the segment.  A gravel or CX bike with at least 40mm tires is probably ideal, but a light XC mtb with fast tires would do just fine.<br/>
 <i>Note from the director:  I don't recall seeing any no trespassing signs on the park side saying not to enter the private driveway, but there is one at the main street at the end of Trey's Lane.  So the second time I rode this segment to respect the locals I didn't ride through the neighborhood, I just went back down and exited the park another way (Samantha way is closest)</i>

 <b>Stage 4 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/16714104?filter=overall" target="_blank">MTB prologue - Shuck n Jive</a><br/>
 This is a shortish, mostly downhill stretch in the Soapstone area.  Lots of turns, a few short uphills to smash the pedals.  I've never done an Enduro race, but I think this would be a good beginner enduro stage.  For both stage 4 and 5, I recommend trying to ride them early in the morning, preferably during the week.  There have been a lot more people hiking in the park recently, especially in the Avalon/OG area. I recommend a recon if you haven't ridden it recently, it is quite possible there could be some downed trees.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 5 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/19835242" target="_blank">2019 Sugar Hill (mtb)</a><br/>
 If you have never raced Sugar Hill, here's your chance!  Again I would recommend going for it during off-peak time.

 <h3 class="special">Running Challenge Stage Details</h3> - Five Stages
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage1 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/1544254" target="_blank">Tumbling down the trolley: </a><br/>
 This is net downhill on the trolley trail, should be super fast. Start near Oella ave, finish shortly before the parking lot.  If you run without your phone just crush it from Oella until you are even with the parking lot and you should get credit for the segment
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage2 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/23262467" target="_blank">Running Tour of EC:</a><br/>
 This is a challenging road segment of nearly 6 miles,and the longest running stage.  Starts at the intersection of Stonecrest and 103, and finishes at the intersection of New Cut and 103.  If you are feeling hardcore you could run back to the start line and get a full 10k
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 3 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/23465653?filter=overall" target="_blank">Up Nun's Down Vineyard. </a><br/>
 Its all in the name!  You start on the Grist Mill trail just upstream of the tunnel to the Vineyard trail.  Head upstream on the Grist Mill trail for almost ½ mile, then turn right through the tunnel.  This puts you on the trail called the “back side of Nun's (there will be some rocks and a creek crossing here so be  cautious).  This is lightly rocky uphill of about 200 meters, before you bear right and head downhill towards the creek bed (if you keep going up you would reach the nunnery and would have gone to far). From here the trail generally follows and crosses the creek bed.  You'll follow this trail out to the power line easement, and make a right turn at the T intersection in the easement (this is the Santee Branch trail).  Follow Santee Branch up, cross Foxhall Farm road, and then you'll see a Vineyard sign (it is a hard right turn and starts taking you back downhill.  Take Vineyard all the way down, recommend carrying your effort all the way through to Grist Mill (safely through the tunnel, especially if it is wet).  GPS can be wonky, so it is best to run a little extra to make sure you complete the segment before you catch your breath.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 4 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/7637134?filter=overall" target="_blank">Relentless Hills </a><br/>
 This is a challenging and scenic 1 mile charge on the Ridge trail in the Orange Grove area.  Starts about  500 meters up the trail from River road (if you take the long uphill drag from the road just downstream of the swinging bridge).  At the Ridge valley view intersection, stay on Ridge and run all the way to where it meets Valley View again.  When you look at the official segment it looks like the finish is a few meters down valley view, but if you look at the current CR, you can see that the runner looks to have continued down Ridge.  I have also got credit for the segment actually taking the valley view turn at the first opportunity, but I wouldn't recommend doing that.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 5 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/846174" target="_blank">Ilchester Road Run Climb:  </a><br/>
 No chance to get lost here.  Starts even with the ilchester trail just up from Bonnie Branch, and finishing just past the Beechwood Rd intersection.  I recommend letting your GPS settle, start running at BB and continue at least 20-30 meters beyond Beechwood.
