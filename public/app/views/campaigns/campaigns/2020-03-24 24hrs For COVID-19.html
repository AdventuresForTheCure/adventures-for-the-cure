    school normally has a mobile food bank but has been shut down due to the crisis. He is trying to see if we can
    raise enough money for them to set up a mobile food bank in the school's parking lot. The food bank has seen a
    six time increase in demand with a lower supply due to lower supply from overwhelmed grocery
    stores.

    The plan is to run for 24 hour starting next Monday. He is asking for overall donations, donations per mile, with
    the option to contribute bonus donation for reaching 100 miles and for any CR's (Strava Course Records aka KOM's in
    cycling terms) along the way.

    He will be using live tracking on Strava and run every street of houses that attend (or will attend due to
    redistricting) Phelps Luck Elementary.
