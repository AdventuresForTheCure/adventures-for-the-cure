      Watts, Watts per Kilogram, Critical Power, Functional Threshold Power. Everyone loves to have a high FTP, here is the chance to find out if you can hold your own FTP for a whole hour. Sound rough, it will be, that is why it should be performed with friends, music, video, and a cool atmosphere.

      AFC will be raising money for Kupenda by cycling for 60 minutes at our Functional Threshold Power (FTP / CP60). Jailbreak Brewery is graciously hosting us in their amazing environment and will be returning 10% of beer sales to the event, even more, they'll give you your first beer free!
    <p>
    </p>
      Sign up below for one of the two time slots, show up to Jailbreak with a recent FTP and a trainer. If you want to participate but don't have a trainer, get with a buddy and sign up for the opposite time slot.

      Do you have a favorite song that really gets you going when you are training, add five dollars to your entry and tell us the name of your song and we'll make sure it gets played during your one hour. Music space is limited so make sure to sign up early and reserve your song!
