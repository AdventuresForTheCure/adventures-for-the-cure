	WHH Fitness' founder and CEO, Rick Callahan, has dedicated his life to helping people live healthier, happier lives through 
	nutrition and fitness education.  He has a personal vendetta against Diabetes Type 1 as his 6 year old daughter is victim to this terrible disease.  
	He would like to raise awareness about this disease as well as inform people that Diabetes Type II, which several of their 
	clients are faced with, is preventable by increasing physical activity and making healthier nutrition choices.
