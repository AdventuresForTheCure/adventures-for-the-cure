	<legend>SYNOPSIS</legend>
	<p>
	Crystal seems to have the perfect life -- a handsome boyfriend, a good steady job and a nice 
	apartment in the city.  Although all is not what it appears to be, when we find out that she 
	is trapped in an abusive relationship.  The film focuses on her trying to escape from that world, 
	using drumming as her outlet.  The Fragile Beat of the Heart revolves around a poem of the same name, 
	written by Andrew Knowlton.

	<legend>WHY IT MATTERS</legend>
	<p>
	Domestic violence is the willful intimidation, physical assault, battery, sexual assault, and/or 
	other abusive behavior perpetrated by an intimate partner against another. It is an epidemic affecting 
	individuals in every community, regardless of age, economic status, race, religion, nationality or 
	educational background.  Violence against women is often accompanied by emotionally abusive and 
	controlling behavior, and thus is part of a systematic pattern of dominance and control. Domestic 
	violence results in physical injury, psychological trauma, and sometimes death. The consequences 
	of domestic violence can cross generations and truly last a lifetime.
