<p align="center"><b class="special">Rules</b></p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Unofficial Event:</b> This is an unofficial event, performed at the participants individual discretion and risk. Anyone can do these segments on their own at anytime. This competition is an attempt to raise funds for AFC charities, provide a much-needed friendly competition in trying times, and finally a chance to be declared an AFC legend!</li>
    <li><b>Time limits:</b> From the start of the race, participants will have 2 weeks to complete all 5 stages. Cycling first, then 2 weeks later the running competition will commence</li>
    <li><b>No hiding:</b> Participants may attempt stages multiple times, but attempts must be made public on Strava the same day they are completed (as close to actual completion as possible!  -no hiding results to the end and surprising everyone with your awesomeness).</li>
    <li><b>Suggested $50 donation per event:</b> So $100 if entering both the cycling and running event.</li>
    <li>No group efforts (except for stage 3, where group rides are allowed at two designated times). If you want to ride or run with 1 or 2 others for safety reasons that is of course allowed. If you do this, make sure to maintain good 'social distance' -no drafting.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p align="center"><b class="special">Cycling Challenge Stage Details</b></p>
  <p>
    <b>Stage 1 - <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/3396458" target="_blank">Ridge - Hanover - Race: Loop</a> -- </b>This covers nearly all of the Elkridge Spring Classic road race loop (minus the 2 stop signs). Starts with the ridge climb, making rights turns to the hanover downhill, and the rest is a TT to the end of Race road.
  <p>
  <b>Stage 2 - <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/27727146" target="_blank">AFC-FC-2021 Mini Fondo</a> -- </b> The Fall Classic Mini Fondo was fun, so we're doing it again, but on a different course for the 2021 Spring Classic.  This time we will take your best segment times from within the same ride, so pace well.   Ride this complete route to qualify, but only the timed segments below count for time&points.  1 May and 8 May will have organized group opportunity to ride the mini fondo with friends (0830 sharp start time at the EC clock!)  can ride the route solo at any other time during the challenge.<br/>
  Timed Segments:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/27684413" target="_blank">College Ave Rollup</a>
    <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/657863?filter=overall" target="_blank">Thistle Climb</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/3587?filter=overall" target="_blank">Ilchester</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/3894804?filter=overall" target="_blank">College Doncaster to 4 way stop at roundhill</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/5183693?filter=overall" target="_blank">Ellicott Mills Frederick to Court House Dr</a></li>
  </ul>
  All 5 of these segments will offer points in both the 'Points' and 'K/QoM' challenges.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Stage 3 - <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/14610715">Sugar Hill Clockwise with Full Garrett's</a> -- </b>If you have never raced Sugar Hill, here's your chance! Again I would recommend going for it during off-peak time.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Bonus K/QoM Segments </b> - Each stage will contain a designated KoM segment (KoM points will be 8,6,4,3,2,1,1,... except Ilchester which offers a few extra points) to be totalled for an aggregate KoM champ
  <ul>
    <li>Stage 1 <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/10748398?filter=overall" target="_blank">Full Ridge Climb</a></li>
    <li>Stage 2 <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/3965620?filter=overall" target="_blank">Get me outta here climb</a></li>
    <li>Stage 3 <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/3587" target="_blank">Ilchester</a> -- All offer points and even some extra</li>
    <li>Stage 4 <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/1131098?filter=overall" target="_blank">Three sisters climb</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p align="center"><b class="special">Running Challenge Stage Details</b></p>
<p>
  <b>Stage 1 - <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/1544254?filter=overall" target="_blank">Tumbling Down the Trolley</a> -- </b>This is net downhill on the trolley trail, should be super fast. Start near Oella ave, finish shortly before the parking lot. Crush it from Oella until you are even with the parking lot and you should get credit for the segment
</p>
<p>
  <b>Stage 2 - <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/23465653?filter=overall" target="_blank">Up Nuns Down Vineyard</a> -- </b>Its all in the name! You start on the Grist Mill trail just upstream of the tunnel to the Vineyard trail. Head upstream on the Grist Mill trail for almost ½ mile, then turn right through the tunnel. This puts you on the trail called the “back side of Nun's (there will be some rocks and a creek crossing here so be cautious). This is lightly rocky uphill of about 200 meters, before you bear right and head downhill towards the creek bed (if you keep going up you would reach the nunnery and would have gone to far). From here the trail generally follows and crosses the creek bed. You'll follow this trail out to the power line easement, and make a right turn at the T intersection in the easement (this is the Santee Branch trail). Follow Santee Branch up, cross Foxhall Farm road, and then you'll see a Vineyard sign (it is a hard right turn and starts taking you back downhill. Take Vineyard all the way down, recommend carrying your effort all the way through to Grist Mill (safely through the tunnel, especially if it is wet). GPS can be wonky, so it is best to run a little extra to make sure you complete the segment before you catch your breath.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Stage 3 - <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/846174?filter=overall" target="_blank">Ilchester</a> -- </b>No chance to get lost here. Starts even with the ilchester trail just up from Bonnie Branch, and finishing just past the Beechwood Rd intersection. I recommend letting your GPS settle, start running at BB and continue at least 20-30 meters beyond Beechwood.
