    <div>
    The successes in my life can be attributed to a mixture of hard work, luck, and the support of some amazing people that stepped in to guide me through the critical moments when I needed it most.  I am incredibly grateful to have been surrounded by supportive parents, teachers and mentors that believed in me and gave me the ability to thrive in the face of some challenging headwinds.

      We are all better, stronger, and more likely to overcome challenges when supported by a community.  The mission of OhanaHC is to be the tailwind that fills the sails of those who need it most.  They identify promising students in the most underserved population in Columbia and create a family of mentors to follow them for 10 years through the most challenging and crucial time in their lives.

   <br/>
    <div>
      Inspired by the Black Lives Matters movement, my aim is to raise money and awareness for this amazing local organization that is serving those who have been underserved for so long.

      When a cyclist drafts off someone or is in a peloton (a group of cyclists), they only have to use about 70% of the relative effort to maintain the same speed.  This is common knowledge in the cycling world, but what is less widely known is that the lead rider receives a 3% efficiency benefit as well.  When we give, we also receive.  I can think of no better metaphor for what OhanaHC is doing, building a peloton for our community.

      Consider donating and joining in for a few laps to literally and figuratively support me in this effort to help improve our community.
