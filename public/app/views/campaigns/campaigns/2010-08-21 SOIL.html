	<p>
		Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods (SOIL) is a non-profit working in Haiti to build public 
		composting toilets and other sustainable development projects to tackle the pressing issues of soil 
		fertility and sanitation in Haiti.  Many Haitians do not have access to toilet facilities, 
		and sanitation-related disease symptoms such as diarrhea are a major cause of death and suffering.  
		This has only been exacerbated with the recent earthquake.  We often take our crap for granted, but 
		dealt with properly through composting it can be a safe and productive economic resource.  
		Composting of human wastes transforms it into a rich agricultural fertilizer that can restore soil and 
		dramatically increase crop yields for subsistence farmers struggling with the clay-like soil.  
		SOIL has been in Haiti for 5 years and is devoted to staying there in the long-term.

		<a href="http://adventuresforthecure.com/team/mensTeam.html#Ethan%20Bodnaruk">Ethan Bodnaruk</a>  
		will be going to Haiti for the month of August to work with SOIL. Before that, he will be riding his bicycle 
		from Greensboro, NC to Florida over 7 days and 700 miles to raise money for SOIL.  From there he will take 
		the short flight to Haiti.  All of the money collected through this website will be sent to SOIL, and is 
		all tax deductible since both AFC and SOIL are 501-(c)3 non-profit groups.

	<ul class="unordered-list" style="padding-left:15px">
		<li>You could give a nickel, dime, or quarter for every mile I ride: $35, $70, or $175!</li>
		<li>Donate the equivalent cost of gasoline for a 700 mile trip by car (nat'l avg = $2.80/gal)</li>
		<li>Assuming a fancy-pants hybrid with 40 mpg: $49</li>
		<li>Standard car with 25 mpg: $78</li>
		<li>The Twalet Arborloo composting toilet (shown in one of the pictures) costs $90 with local construction and supplies.</li>
		<li>Based on my own calculations and data from the Humanure Handbook, I might produce about 30.8 pounds of fecal matter and urine over my 7 day bike ride.*    </li>
		<li>One dollar per pound = $31;  Two dollars per pound = $62</li>
