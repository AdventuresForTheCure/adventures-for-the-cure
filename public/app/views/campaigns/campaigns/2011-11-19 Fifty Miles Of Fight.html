<fieldset><legend>The Making</legend>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.jfk50mile.org/" target="_blank">
	    JFK 50</a> is a horseshoe shaped 50 mile foot race on the Appalachian Trail, C&O canal and streets of 
		Washington County, MD. It was originally created by President John F. Kennedy to challenge his 
		military officers in meeting the requirements that Teddy Roosevelt had set out for his military 
		personnel at the dawn of the 20th century. The officers had 20 hours to finish the 50 mile 
		course on foot. No bikes, no motor cars, no horses - just your legs.

	On November 19th, 2011, <a href="https://adventuresforthecure.com/team/mensTeam.html#Brent Scheitlin">
	Brent Scheitlin</a> will be running in the same footprints of those brave soldiers, 
	however, he only has 12 hours to complete the 50 mile task. Not only has he challenged himself 
	in running a distance of 50 miles in 12 hours, but he has also challenged himself to raise as 
	much money as possible for the <a href="http://www.ccfa.org/" target="_blank">Crohn's and Colitis Foundation</a>. With donated money we hope to 
	find a cause and cure for these diseases which inhabit so many people worldwide.
