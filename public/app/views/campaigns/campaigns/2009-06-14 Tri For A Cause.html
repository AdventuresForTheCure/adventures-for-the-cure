		Covering 70.3 miles is no easy task when you are using your own personal power to get to the finish line.  
		Swimming 1.2 miles, biking 56 miles and then running 13.1 can seem overwhelming and extremely challenging.  
		But think about those living with Diabetes and the challenges that they face every day.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On June 14th, 2009, 3 incredibly inspiring people will be competing in a 1/2 ironman triathlon to show those 
		diagnosed with Diabetes and their families how leading a healthy and active lifestyle can move you beyond 
		your perceived limits, and to raise funds for Diabetes research.  If you would like to support the cause, 
		please consider sponsoring us for each mile that we cover during the race.  You will be helping us to raise 
		awareness and funds for diabetes research, education and advocacy.
