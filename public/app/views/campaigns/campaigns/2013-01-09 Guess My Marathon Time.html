	<h4>
		<strong>Guess My Marathon Time</strong></h4>
</div>
<p>
	The Boston Marathon is arguably the most prestigious footrace in the world. First run on April 19, 1897 it has become a mecca for marathon distance runners. As the popularity grew qualifying times were introduced to keep the race both competitive and intimate in size. The allusive qualifying time has added to the cache` of the race and has been a driving factor for runners to push their physical and mental limits. I was introduced to the mystique of Boston by a friend and it inspired me to run my first race ever,&nbsp; the Baltimore Marathon,&nbsp; in 2009 in a time of 5:16:27 with an injury . The experience of that race forever changed my life and set me on the quest to qualify. There is no better way to reach a goal than arm and arm with friends,&nbsp; and after a year of training made an attempt in 2010 at Baltimore again and narrowly missed my qualifying time by 8 seconds (3:11:07). Third time was the charm and after another year of training qualified at the 2011 Philadelphia Marathon with a time of 3:07:30.<br />

	<strong>The charities you will be helping: Kupenda for the Children and Y of Central Maryland Summer camp program.</strong></p>
<p>
	Kupenda assists the Malindi and Margareni Districts along the coast of Kenya.</p>
<p>
	Kupenda for the Children assists children with disabilities by paying school fees via one-on-one sponsorships, constructing special needs facilities, funding medical intervention, providing school supplies and medical equipment, creating awareness in the community, strengthening local churches for advocacy and assistance, and staffing qualified help for the children in need. This assistance not only helps children with disabilities to grow, learn, and adapt, but it creates awareness among parents and within communities in Kenya.</p>
<p>
	<b>Y of Central Maryland Summer Camp Program</b><br />
	For many children, summer is an opportunity to try new things, go new places, laugh, play, and act like children! But sadly, for far too many young people in our community, summer doesn&#39;t fit this mold. Rather, it means time spent at home alone, sedentary activities, and perhaps endless opportunities to get in trouble.</p>
<p>
	Children from all families, regardless of their ability to pay, should have the opportunity to enjoy a Y Journeys camp experience. Please help send a child to camp today.</p>
<p>
	Without the support of compassionate people like you, 1 out of every 4 children will miss out on the summer learning opportunities they so richly deserve. 100% of your donation goes straight to direct service for the children.</p>
<p>
	Thank you again for your donation and stay tuned for updates!</p>
