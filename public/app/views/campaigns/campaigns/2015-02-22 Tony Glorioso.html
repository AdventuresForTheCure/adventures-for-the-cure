    Anthony Steven Glorioso’s heroic 9-month fight came to an end Saturday, February 21st.  Tony took his final breaths surrounded by family and close friends inside the Shock Trauma unit at UMMC.
  </p>
  <p align="left" style="text-align: left;">
    Tony was just 29 years old, but he’d inspired and touched lives with his perseverance, dedication, and infectious personality.  Tony enjoyed adventures with his friends and family, all things Disney related, rooting for Manchester United, and filling silence with laughter.
  </p>
  <p  align="left" style="text-align: left;">
    The family asks that in lieu of flowers you honor Tony’s life by donating to his cycling team, Adventures for a Cure, in support of their commitment to the fight against diabetes and children with disabilities in Kenya.
