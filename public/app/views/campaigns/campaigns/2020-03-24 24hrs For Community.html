    school normally has a mobile food bank but has been shut down due to the crisis.  He wants to try to help in some
    way by raising money for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cac-hc.org/">Community Action Council of Howard County</a>
    which runs the Food Bank plus provides housing assistance, energy assistance and advocates for low income families.
    I think a lot of our low income families are going to be hurt particularly hard by this economic slow down as many
    are hourly workers who are no longer employed or under employed.
