    school normally has a mobile food bank but has been shut down due to the crisis.  He wants to try to help in some
    way by raising money for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cac-hc.org/">Community Action Council of Howard County</a>
    which runs the Food Bank plus provides housing assistance, energy assistance and advocates for low income families.
    I think a lot of our low income families are going to be hurt particularly hard by this economic slow down as many
    are hourly workers who are no longer employed or under employed.

    The plan is to run for 24 hour starting next Monday. He is asking for overall donations, donations per mile, with
    the option to contribute bonus donation for reaching 100 miles and for any CR's (Strava Course Records aka KOM's in
    cycling terms) along the way.
