		We are filled with gratitude. We would like to thank each of you from the bottom of our hearts. 
		What a wonderful gift you have given not only Luke, but our entire family. It\'s hard to believe 
		something that started as a hope so long ago has blossomed into reality. We especially want to 
		thank Mike West for seeing our need and out of the goodness of his heart spearheading this project; 
		Keith Rohr for using his professional and personal knowledge to help with the specifics of the bike; 
		Adventures for the Cure for organizing the fundraising; and Jeff Dalik at <a href="http://bikedoctorlinthicum.com"/>
		Bike Doctor Linthicum</a> for his technical expertise and contacts. We have been blown away by this gift and are deeply 
		touched and honored to be the recipients of such pure generosity.

		This bike is AWESOME and is ready for action. Next warm day we will be sure to join the Wright\'s 
		for a ride. We thank <a href="http://bikedoctorlinthicum.com">Bike Doctor</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.kidztandem.com/">Chris Brown</a>, and all of the supporters that helped make this bike 
		possible.

		None of this could be possible without you! Because of you Luke will now be able to enjoy a beautiful 
		ride with his father.<br/><br/>

		Luke is an awesome little guy who was born with special needs.  Due to a recent virus, Luke\'s ability

		Adventures For the Cure, along with your help, would like to build a special bicycle 
		that will allow his father to take him out on bike rides.  The bicycle will be built by our friend, 
		Mike West, and costs about $2k.  We have committed to helping this child and we ask that others who feel 
		inspired by this family prayerfully consider this effort.
