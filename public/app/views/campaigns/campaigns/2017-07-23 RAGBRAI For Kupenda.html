      Adventures for the Cure and Dan Zavorka are at it again! On Sunday July 23rd, the AFC cyclist will begin his seven day ride across the state of Iowa in hopes of raising money for <a href="http://kupenda.org" target="_blank">Kupenda for the Children</a>. The 400 plus mile ride will be documented along the way on Instagram under #AFC4Kupenda
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to raise <span class="special">$1,000</span> to help children with disabilities in Kenya receive food, shelter, care, and education. Due to a local stigma, these children are often mistreated or even killed because they are believed to be cursed by God. With your help, however, you can make a difference in these communities by partnering with Dan and AFC to empower the lives of 170 children!

Kupenda serves children with disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, deafness, deformed or missing limbs, spina bifida, the effects of polio, visual impairment, Downsâ€™ syndrome, autism, epilepsy, and other physical and mental disabilities.
