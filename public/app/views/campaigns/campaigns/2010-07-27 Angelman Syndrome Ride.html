<fieldset><legend>A Thank You From The Wrights</legend>
Dear Friends,<br/><br/>
<p>
Once again you have filled our hearts with gratitude. thank you for supporting this exciting fundraiser. We truly appreciate your gift to the Angelman Syndrome Foundation as Luke and Stephen rode from Cumberland, MD to Georgetown on the C&O Canal towpath. We feel so blessed that you are willing to give to the Foundation even during difficult economic times. Our entire family had great fun and purpose participating in this adventure - from bike riders, to sag support and cheerleaders. We want to give a special thank you to AFC for being the fundraising intermediary and those that joined us along the way, either riding on the canal or celebrating its completion. Thank you again for your generosity.
</p>
Love,<br/>
Stephen, Julie, Luke and Zoe Wright

	Stephen Wright is a fitness bike rider and former racer in Howard County, MD. His son, Luke has Angelman Syndrome. Recently, 
	the AFC organization was the catalyst for raising funds for a bike which allowed Stephen to ride with his son. Now that 
	the bike is here and fully operational, Stephen wants to ride a challenging ride to raise money for the Angelman Syndrome 
	Foundation.
