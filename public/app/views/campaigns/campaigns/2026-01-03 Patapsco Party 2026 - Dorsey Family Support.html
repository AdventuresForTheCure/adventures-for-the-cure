  The Patapsco Party is about community, adventure, and helping others.
</p>
<p>
  This year’s Patapsco Party is dedicated to supporting the family of one of our own. Darrel Dorsey is an active member
  of our local ultrarunning community and a Patapsco Party veteran. Earlier this year, his wife, Angela Dorsey, was
  diagnosed with colon cancer. Her illness has since progressed, and she has recently entered hospice care. This effort
  is one way our running community is coming together to support the Dorsey family during this incredibly difficult
  time.
</p>
<p>
  Angela and Darrel have two children, Declan and Lila. All funds raised through this year’s Patapsco Party will go
  directly toward the Dorsey Family. This is our way of helping provide stability and opportunity in the years ahead,
  and of showing the strength and love of our community.
