<h1 align="center">AFC Family Adventure Race</h1>
<p>
  Adventures for the Cure is excited to announce that we will be hosting a family/kid friendly adventure race on
  Sunday August 8th, 2021 at 9:00 am near the Daniel's area of Patapsco Valley State Park. If you have never done an
  adventure race before check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2wId8qZKhI" target="_blank">video</a>
  by <a href="https://www.grit-adventures.com/" target="_blank">GRIT Adventures</a> to get an idea of what it looks
  like.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>There will be two options for courses; An easier course for younger and less experienced racers. And a challenging
    course for more experienced racers. The race will have a time limit of 3-4 hours depending on the course your team
    is completing. This DOES NOT mean you have to race for that long. Teams can race for as long or as little as you
    want and get as many points as you want.
  </li>
  <li>The recommended minimum age is 8-9 years old. Racers who are under 18 years old but have completed level
    2/advanced GRIT training may race on a team without an adult. Otherwise minors must race with an adult.
  </li>
  <li>This is a fundraiser campaign where all proceeds will go to ________ charity. The recommended per team
    donation is $50.
  </li>
  <li>Family members that are not racing are welcome to hang out or hike the course to watch the racers.
  </li>
  <li>This is a low key event for the AFC and GRIT communities so please do not share this race information with
    others. If we see that there is more room then we may open it up to others at a later date.
