<fieldset><legend>Rich's Bio</legend>
	<p>
	Mr. Rich", as he has been called by tens of thousands of children over the years,
	says he does not have a lot of money, but is very rich because of his family, many
	friends, good health, insulin, and a beautiful 16 acre property where he lives and
	works. (Check the webpage, <a href="http://gnomecountryside.com" target="_blank">gnomecountryside.com</a>)
	</p>
	<p>
	Rich was born in 1942 in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, about 45 miles
	northwest of Penn State.
	</p>
	<p>
	His father passed away at the age of 42, Rich was six. Rich's mother, Margaret,
	never remarried, so there were just the two of them. Margaret lived to be 98,
	and when she was younger, spent lots of time in the woods with her son. They
	went on many walks together, and Rich was given his appreciation of the natural
	environment from his loving mom. When Rich was 14, he contracted type 1
	diabetes. At the small county hospital, where he was treated, he was put on
	the wrong kind of insulin, and remembers feeling horrible. He stopped taking
	the insulin and within two weeks, lost 20 pounds. Life expectancy for a type 1
	diabetic, before insulin, was 3 years. His mom heard the Cleveland Clinic was
	considered a first class facility for helping people living with diabetes, and so Rich
	and his mom made the 200 mile bus trip to Cleveland. There were no restrooms
	on buses at this time, and since high blood sugars cause excessive urination, Rich
	was in agony for most of the ride. He had to ask the bus driver to stop a couple of
	times during the trip. After being put on two insulins that suited him well, ultra
	lente, (in your body for 36 hours, so it overlapped and caused some severe low
	blood sugar problems), and semi lente, (a faster acting insulin in your body for 8-
	10 hours), when the doses were regulated, Rich couldn't believe what it felt like
	to feel good, he hadn't for some time.
	</p>
	<p>
	Rich graduated from high school in 1960, and the Maryland Institute College of
	Art, in 1965.
	</p>
	<p>
	That summer, he backpacked overseas by himself, carrying his glass syringe in a
	test tube filled with alcohol, he needed to sharpen the syringe with a wet stone.
	</p>
	<p>
	In 1967, he was married, and the couple pulled their 13' shasta motorhome
	with their new 1967 mustang convertible, to Haines, Alaska, where they taught
	</p>
	<p>
	school for a year. They saved a lot of money in Alaska, and in 1969, were able to
	backpack overseas.
	</p>
	<p>
	Rich taught during the school year, and in the summertime, was program director
	for Camp Ho Mita Koda, one of the oldest camps in the world for children living
	with diabetes. The camp was established in 1929 by Betty and Henry John. While
	directing the camp in the nineties, Rich traveled to Japan to speak about Ho Mita
	Koda, which in Sioux means, welcome my friend.
	</p>
	<p>
	In 1980, after living with diabetes for 24 years, without a testkit to check his
	blood sugars, Rich began losing his eyesight. Diabetes is one of the leading causes
	of blindness. He also suffered from neuropathy. After losing his sight in one
	eye for a year and a half, he regained his sight because of laser treatments. His
	neuropathy was reversed with a natural herb called quercetin.
	</p>
	<p>
	Because of his eyesight and trying to get his blood sugars in better control, Rich
	gave up his teaching position in 1980, and opened Gnome Countryside, a nature
	trail for the young, and the young of heart. Rich continues to do his work today.
	</p>
	<p>
	In 1976, when Rich was 33, he made a trip around the world. He had a goal to
	do this for years. Highlights of the trip were: Working three months in Israel,
	flying from Tokio to Anchorage, Alska, hitchhiking across Alaska in April, and then
	visiting the 5th grade students he'd had in Haines who were graduating, and then
	going on to Oregon by way of the Inland Passage.
	</p>
	<p>
	Rich's mom had shipped his ten-speed bicycle to relatives in Corvallis, and Rich
	began his 45 day bike ride back cross country. He did all of this without a test kit,
	(no way to test his blood sugar), which he is still in awe of. Rich helped to start
	Camp Setebaid in 1979. ( Setebaid is diabetes spelled backwards), and is still in
	operation today.
	</p>
	<p>
	In 2007, Rich walked from Camp Ho Mita Koda to his home in Lancaster County,
	some 380 miles. He raised $8,000.00 for the camp and met many wonderful
	people along the way.
	</p>
	<p>
	Exercise has been a critical part of his life. That waltz was Rich's incentive for
	</p>
	<p>
	his "Waltz Accross America". He wants to be an example for children living with
	diabetes and their parents, that although we live with a severe chronic disease,
	we can have a full, creative, adventuresome and satisfying life.
	</p>
	<p>
	Rich has a deep appreciation for organizations like "Adventures for The Cure,
	DESTINY ( Diabetes Exercise Strategies Together in Network with You), and
	insulindependence, for the promotion of an extreme active lifestyle for young
	people living with diabetes.
	</p>
	<p>
	He would also like to genuinely thank his three children, Luke, Kesse and
	Kourtney, and his wife, Linda, for their support, and also his neighbor, Annette,
	for her generous help with the computer work she has so graciously done.
