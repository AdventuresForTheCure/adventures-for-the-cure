		<span class="extraspecial"><u>Physical Therapy</u></span><br/>
		It costs just <span class="extraspecial">$100</span> for a child to receive a year of physical therapy. Children that attend the 
		Gede Special School for handicapped children receive daily physical therapy through Kupenda's 
		general fund.  In addition, some children not yet in school, but who are still in need of assistance, also benefit from Kupenda's services. 
		Children who have literally been carried in for therapy are now enjoying the benefit of running.

		<span class="extraspecial"><u>Emergency Medical Attention</u></span><br/>
		Children that attend any of the 11 special needs facilities in the Malindi District are often in need of 
		emergency medical attention. For <span class="extraspecial">$1500</span> a year, an emergency medical transportation and medical assistance 
		fund is made available to over 500 children with disabilities. This means emergency medical attention for 
		an average of just $3 per child per year! Some of the emergency needs include malaria treatment, doctor 
		visits for epileptic attacks, shunting, and other services.

		<span class="extraspecial"><u>Classroom Furniture</u></span><br/>
		Approximately <span class="extraspecial">$200</span> funds the purchase of furniture for an entire special needs classroom. Many classrooms
		 in the Malindi District of Kenya do not have desks or chairs--even in the classrooms for children without disabilities. 
		 Kupenda funds the purchase of regular desks, u-tables for deaf classes, chairs, and other important items for our children.

		<span class="extraspecial"><u>Assistance Equipment</u></span><br/>
		Some of the equipment needs of the Kupenda children include crutches, wheelchairs, and leg braces.  
		The price of a wheelchair in Kenya is approximately <span class="extraspecial">$350</span>.  
		It is best to send funds rather than sending the items, since shipping overseas can be more 
		costly than simply purchasing the items in Kenya.  This also helps to support the local economy.

		<span class="extraspecial"><u>Corrective Surgery</u></span><br/>
		Kupenda funds corrective surgeries, which include surgery for children that suffer from contractures 
		(due to cerebral palsy), spina bifida treatment, heart problems associated with Down's syndrome, club foot 
		correction, and other needs of children with disabilities. Kupenda partners with Kijabe Hospital for crippled 
		children in addition to the Association for the Physically Disabled of Kenya (APDK) for medical treatment of 
		special needs children in the Malindi District. With this assistance, the average cost Kupenda expends on corrective 
		surgery is only approximately <span class="extraspecial">$850</span> per child. The cost fluctuates depending on the type of surgery.

		<span class="extraspecial"><u>Car</u></span><br/>
		The lack of transportation has become a major obstacle in assisting children with disabilities. 
		Frequently, children at the Gede Special Needs Boarding Facility have epileptic fits or other medical 
		emergencies that require immediate assistance.  Additionally, children with disabilities have a 
		difficult time showing up for class because public transportation is difficult for those in wheelchairs. 
		As Kupenda's activities expand, the organization is also reaching more and more children in rural 
		areas of the Malindi District where there is almost no public transportation. A vehicle would help 
		both existing Kupenda-sponsored children, as well as many more who need to be reached.

		<span class="extraspecial"><u>Student/Teacher Supplies</u></span><br/>
		Often, items such as classroom supplies, texts, and teacher materials are needed at the Kupenda-sponsored schools.  
		Giving to this fund would help to adequately supply classrooms. This would greatly 
		enhance the teacher's effectiveness.  Monies for student uniforms are also needed.
