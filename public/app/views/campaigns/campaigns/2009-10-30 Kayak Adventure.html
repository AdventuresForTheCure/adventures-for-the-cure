		This January \'09 Kris will be kayaking from Everglades City, FL down to Flamingo just off the Florida Keys.  
		He will be traveling through swamp, marsh, mangrove forests and ocean.   With abundant wild 
		life including crocodiles, alligators, sharks and dolphins in addition to all types of birds.  
		The trip will be roughly 120 miles, and it will take roughly 7 days.  There is no fresh water anywhere 
		in the everglades so he will have to bring everything himself.  Tides and wind will be major factors
		in his trip.
