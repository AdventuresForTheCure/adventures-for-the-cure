<p align="center"><b class="special">Columbia Gear Closet - Mission Statement</b></p>
Exploring and adventuring the great outdoors can be an amazing experience, but the high cost of gear can often be a barrier to entry into this wonderful world. It is our mission at Columbia Gear Closet, to increase diversity and opportunities for all community members to get outside by lending safe, quality gear to our community. The public donates gently used gear that we clean, fix, and certify as safe; and then members of the community can apply to borrow the gear to have their own life-changing outdoor experiences.

 <p align="center"><b class="special">Event Decription</b></p>
 This event is a 2 part, one month long stage race utilizing some memorable and fun roads and trails in and around Patapsco Valley State Park. Part one is a multidisciplinary 5 stage cycling event consisting of 3 road stages, 1 mountain biking stage, and one 1 Cyclocross style stage. Part two is a 5 stage running event, with 1 pavement stage, and 4 mostly trail stages.  This will be very similar to the Spring Classic we did earlier this year, but with different stages and a few fun twists.

 <b class="special">Rules</b><br/>
</p>
<p>
 <ul>
  <li><b>Unofficial Event:</b> This is an unofficial event, performed at the participants individual discretion and risk. Anyone can do these segments on their own at anytime. This competition is an attempt to raise funds for AFC charities, provide a much needed friendly competition in trying times, and finally a chance to be declared an AFC legend!</li>
  <li><b>Time limits:</b> From the start of the race, participants will have 2 weeks to complete all 5 stages. Cycling first, then 2 weeks later the running competition will commence.</li>
  <li><b>No hiding:</b> Participants may attempt stages multiple times, but attempts must be made public on Strava the same day they are completed (as close to actual completion as possible!  -no hiding results to the end and surprising everyone with your awesomeness).</li>
  <li><b>Suggested $50 donation per event:</b> So $100 if entering both the cycling and running event.</li>
  <li><b>No group efforts:</b> This is especially important on the cycling  road stages 1 and 2.  If you want to ride or run with 1 or 2 others for safety reasons that is of course allowed.  If you do this, make sure to maintain good 'social distance' -no drafting.  We will look at Strava Flyby to make sure people are following the spirit of this rule.</li>
  <li>Exception to group efforts on stage 3, where group rides are allowed at two designated times –31 Oct and 7 Nov at 0800</li>
  <li>Scoring: There will be placing based on GC (total time for all timed segments), Points (assigned based on placing on each stage), and KoM/QoM  (points assigned for an individual section of each segment).</li>

 <span class="special">2 road, 1 “mixed surface”, and 2 mountain bike</span>
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 1 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/25454394" target="_blank">Stage 1- River to Hilltop</a><br/>
 Starting near the intersection of 144 and Oella with a fast stretch to the river road turn off. Watch out for the quick downhill turns on river, then put the hammer down.  Be ready for a hard hairpin turn onto Hilltop road, and get ready to climb.  Once you get to the top of the steep climb, you are still not done.  Smash the false flat and gentle uphill all the way to the intersection of Hilltop and Branston.  Win your category and earn a 30 second time bonus!  <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/12456911" target="_blank">K/QoM Hilltop Correct Profile</a>.

<p>
 <b>Stage 2 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/24154145" target="_blank">Stage 2- Folly /tri/144 U-Shape</a><br/>
 this starts on Folly Quarter just south of 144.  Ride all the way to the traffic circle and take the first right to stay on Folly Quarter.  Next turn is a right on Triadelphia, take it all they way to 144 and take another right.  The segment finish is just short of the Marriotsville rd intersection.  <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/9349082" target="_blank">K/QoM Folly Quarter Climb</a>.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 3 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/25454415" target="_blank">The Mini Fondo.</a><br/>
 This has most of the challenging hills around old Ellicott City.  Ride the full course, but only the 5 timed segments count towards points and GC time.    My hope is to do this as a group ride at 2 designated times during the cycling challenge, while maintaining the option for challengers to do it solo at any time during the 2 week window.  Final decision on whether to do this as a group event (at a set time on Saturday the 31st and on Nov 7th for two options).  <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/3587" target="_blank">K/QoM Ilchester (double points for KoM only)</a>.

 </ul>
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 4 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/25375611" target="_blank">Hilly Sugar</a><br/>
 Pretty much just like the Spring Classic course, but with a few twists including the Bloede up climb, the capt smith loop, and... its in the opposite direction.  <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/21275199" target="_blank">K/Q0M Bloede Up</a>.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 5 -</b> <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/25375566" target="_blank">Rockburn CX Lap</a><br/>
 4 laps of this 'simplified' CX course in rockburn.  The lap is pretty straightforward, the only 'quirk' is that at the top of the gravel climb you enter the parking lot, head left and pick up the paved pathway again.  This is to make sure everyone does the K/QoM segment right :).  <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/2688462" target="_blank">K/QoM Gravel Climb</a> uphill from lot to lot.

 <b class="special">Running Challenge Stage Details</b>
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage1 - </b> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/segments/1684018">Grist Mill: Red Underpass to Swinging Bridge</a><br/>
 This is a straightforward 'prologue' on the Grist Mill trail, starting at the Vineyard tunnel and finishing at the Swinging bridge.  This is the shortest stage, so category winners claim a 30 second time bonus.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage2 - </b> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/segments/24972603">Nuns to Water Bars</a><br/>
 Probably the toughest of the running stages.  Start just over the railroad tracks up the hill from Swinging bridge and head up the climb the Nun's climb.  follow the pavement up just past the park maintence facility entrance, then turn right onto the Santee Branch trail.  Take Santee Branch over to the junction with the Vineyard Springs trail, but take the left turn down what is known as the Bike Jumper downhill.  This is a pretty technical downhill, so be cautious and save some energy because you will immediately be going back uphill again once you reach the bottom.  You will then follow the Bull Run trail in a Clockwise direction until it intersects with the Soapstone trail.  Follow Soapstone down to the creek crossing, then take the road all the way down through the tunnel.  Once you pass through the tunnel, bear left but cross the parking lot and follow the trail along the river (Gunned) until you reach Gun road.  Take a right on Gun road, cross the bridge, then bear right and push hard down River road.  The finish will be just before the Gravel road that starts the Water Bars climb.  Push all the way to the gravel and you are done!
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 3 - </b> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/segments/25421904">A Taste of Sugar</a><br/>
 This is the first half of the Sugar Hill MTB course, but starting just up the Rockburn Branch Trail from the intersection with the top of Water Bars.  You do the Rockburn branch loop then follow Morning choice to the first intersection with the Old Track Loop.  Take the right and follow the Old track loop (counterclockwise) until it intersects with Morning Choice again.  Bear right onto Morning Choice and follow until the right turn that cuts over to Barley and Hops.  Take the connector trail over to Barley and Hops, and then turn right at the intersection and follow B&H until the top of the hill.  Then take the left onto Lewis and Clark. Stay left on Lewis and Clark (if you miss the turn you'll wind up on Morning Choice again) Follow this trail across Norris Lane until you reach the Cascade Trail.  Take the Cascade trail all the way down to Cascade Falls, the segment ending just before the rocky 'steps' down to the falls.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 4 - </b> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/segments/23105090">Garrett's Up</a><br/>
 This is a hard one to describe, but pretty well traveled.  If you haven't done it I highly recommend a recon with someone who has done it before.
</p>
<p>
 <b>Stage 5 - </b> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/segments/25467384">Bloede Back 2 The Bridge</a><br/>
 Start on the climb up from the Cascade Fall trail.  The segment starts after a little (sometimes dry) creek crossing about 50-100 meters from the main cascade trail.  Take the trail all the way up, cross Garretts to stay on upper Cascade, continue about 100 meters and then take a left onto the lower part of garretts (If you go to the large rocks on the right of the trail you have gone ~50 meters too far).  After a few switchbacks, and right after a large downed tree, take a left on to the Bloede Dam trail.  Follow this trail all the way down to River Road, and push hard all the way to the Swinging Bridge.
