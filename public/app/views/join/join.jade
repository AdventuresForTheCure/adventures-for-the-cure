  h4 Our Team Ideology
  p
    | We want to use our love of endurance athletics to make a difference in the world!  Sport can
    | be a very selfish endeavor, we want to take it and make it into something that is more than
    | just training, racing, getting fit, and having fun.  We want to keep all of the 'fun' and then
    | add charity, giving back, and selflessness on top of that!  To join our team, please email
    | us at <span class="email">afc-board-of-directors@googlegroups.com</span>.
