   My name is Austin Butts, this is my first year of doing Triathlon and Cyclo-cross racing at a competitive level. I have always enjoyed individual sports that push you to your mental and physical limits and enjoy what i get out of racing. I found out about AFC from a guy named Paul Tarter and also Ty Long who invited me one day to join in on a group ride. However Paul didn't really explain how intense this WED group ride would be at the HUB. well after going over Ilchester and a couple other notable climbs I was completely exhausted, but couldn't help but smile as I watched a rather large group of riders in front of me enjoy the ride they were on. I have enjoyed the atmosphere that this group of riders have to offer and to top it all off you guys support kids who have some harder times enjoying what we do. I also volunteer for a Charity called Ainsleys Angles of Maryland and have thoroughly enjoyed bringing joy to kids with cerebral palsy and similar illnesses by pushing them through short course foot races. I would love to be apart of this team to become a better cyclist and help out with your guys volunteer work.
