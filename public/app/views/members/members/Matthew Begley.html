	I genuinely love all activities outdoors, I&#39;m a water boy at heart and surfing is probably my number one passion. &nbsp;I ran Track for the University of New Hampshire; my events being the Polevault and 4x400m relay. &nbsp;Post graduation I found myself missing the competitiveness and camaraderie I had at UNH. &nbsp;I started cycling to stay in shape and attempt to keep my surfing bug &quot;at bay&quot; between swells and the flat East Coast summers. &nbsp;Soon after I was linked up with a few AFC&#39;ers and haven&#39;t looked back since joining the team in 2010. &nbsp;I primarily ride road, sprinting being my strength but have dabbled with mountain bike and cyclocross. &nbsp;I look forward to training and competing on a more serious level over the next couple years; along with traveling for some mountain bike camping trips! &nbsp; AFC is a great team with a place for everyone, I look forward to every Adventure! &nbsp;</p>
