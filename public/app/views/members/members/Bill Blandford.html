<div class="paragraph">Bill is an MTB racer that prefers to race rigid single speeds in endurance venues.   	He joined AFC in 2009 after realizing that many of his new themorningride.com buddies are also AFC members.   	Joining AFC seemed predestined for Bill, who lost a younger brother to diabetes in 2002 and now races for AFC  	to heighten awareness in his brother's memory.  Bill and his family of six are all avid cyclists who enjoy a  	thorough regimen of mountain, road, and fixed gear training and recreational riding year round.  Wrenching on  	bikes is another passion of his.  Recently he has taken up unicycling (Anything is Possible!) and hopes to take  	it off road as skills improve.</div></div>
