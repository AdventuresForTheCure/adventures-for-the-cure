	Mainly a runner but I can be seen riding or hanging out with the AFC people wearing their gear, 
	drinking, and eating their supplies. I have been friends with the Adam and Pat since college 
	and was part of the support team on the first RAAM trip. I hope to do more for AFC and for the 
	support of diabetes research and any humanitarian efforts.
