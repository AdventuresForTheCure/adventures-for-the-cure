    I am new to Maryland in the last year after living in Colorado for almost 18 years.  IWe were fortunate to live in Durango and be so close to Moab to enjoy amazing riding.  I as well as my husband have been riding for many years.  The riding here in Maryland has been amazing as we enjoy lots of single track.  I was a part of a girl's riding group in Durango Colorado that I did events with and hope to continue that here.  I have already met a ton of great bikers/people in this community near Ellicott City.  As I continue to explore, I am interested in becoming involved in more events such as the EPIC and the Shenandoah 100 but as a medical volunteer as that is my other passion.  I work as a nurse practitioner.  Plus, I can only do so much exercise;)  I love to travel, cook, and play in my garden when I have a chance.  We are avid mushroom foragers and just love being in the woods.  That's why mountain biking keeps us sane!
