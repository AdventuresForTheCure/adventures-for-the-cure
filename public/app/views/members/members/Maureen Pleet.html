<p>I love mountain biking.&nbsp;Have been riding for over 15 years and still look forward to every ride, race or event. Looking&nbsp;foward to using my love of biking to help AFC&#39;s causes&nbsp;in any way I can.&nbsp;My cycling goals are&nbsp;usually just to enjoy being out there and having fun, though this year I&#39;m&nbsp;thinking of attempting the Shenandoah 100 in honor of my Mother.&nbsp;Finish or not I&#39;ll enjoy the challenge and have fun :) Looking&nbsp;forward to meeting everyone at AFC and making new friends. &nbsp;</p>
