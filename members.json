As a kid, I owned one bike–a mountain bike–and rode it everywhere.  I even managed a century with knobby tires and toe clips when I was 14, although I didn't do another until 2015.  Even in those early days, my primary focus was throwing myself at hills as hard and as fast as I could.  I grew up in Ithaca, NY, so there were lots of options.  Fun fact: I still own and occasionally use the bike I bought when I was 15.  It's a Mongoose IBOC Comp and it still makes me smile when I see it.\r\n\nIn 2005, Laura, my wife, got a road bike.  The smoothness and speed on pavement lured me in and once I had one I was hooked.  Although I did mountain bike a fair amount during the three years that we lived in Montana, these days I'm almost exclusively on the road.  The road bike helped me push even harder and faster up hills and then I discovered Strava.  It's like it was translated right out of my head.  A way to record and compare speeds?  Sign me up!\r\n\nSomewhere around 2012 I discovered the 'polar' opposite of road bikes: fat bikes and riding in the snow.  It blew my mind, and now we own a fat bike and are always hoping for lots of snow in the winter.  (We hope for snow anyway, it's what makes winter fun.)  One of my riding highlights each year is riding up, and then back down, Vail mountain before it opens to skiers for the day.  It's over an hour of non-stop climbing followed by flying down the mountain on green runs and catwalks.  Fat bikes really make you feel like a kid again.\r\n\nMy run down Vail notwithstanding, I'm a pretty cautious rider.  I did a few mountain bike races in high school, but lost a lot of ground whenever the trail tilted down.  Since then I haven't raced at all.  The prospect of crashes has kept me from signing up so far, but who knows what the future holds.  For now I'm content to ride as much as I can and push myself every ride.  I guess I haven't changed that much since my early days.\r\n\nWhen I'm not riding, I'm working as a multimedia producer in Astrophysics and Heliophysics at the Goddard Space Flight Center, or spending time with Laura and our two kids.  The kids haven't really caught the cycling bug.  Yet.  I also climb regularly (bouldering only,) and am a reasonably voracious reader.\r\n\nThe cycling community in this area is absolutely fantastic, and the level of encouragement and positivity is wonderful to see.  I really enjoy all the group rides I do and all the great people I've met through cycling.e met through cycling.","__v":0}

My parents, both workaholics, had no way to get me to and from lacrosse and football practice each day. I decided to solve their problem and convince them to buy me a brand new Specialized mountain bike.  Sure riding 5 miles in full pads is a bit awkward, but I loved it! Like a teenager with a license...I was free!  The B\u0026A trail was my highway.\n\nAfter college, I moved to Federal Hill, partied way too much and gained 50lbs. I needed a lifestyle change.  Lacrosse had always kept me in shape, but with that no longer an option, a friend suggested riding Patapsco a couple times a week with him.  I lost all the weight and had a blast doing it... I was hooked!  My riding slowed down when I got married and had my daughter.  Even though my wife encouraged me to keep riding, I just never seemed to find the time.  That is until I met Martin Leska at the pool last summer and found common ground with mountain bikes.  We met up one day for a casual ride (or so I thought) and I was quickly introduced to endurance mountain biking!  That day about killed me, but I woke up the next morning wanting more.  I researched AFC, read the mission statement, and immediately wanted to join. \n\nThis year I look forward to riding a few 100 milers and most importantly help raise as much money as possible to help a great cause.","__v":0}

Always have, always will. I started riding in the 6th grade when my mom somehow let me ride back + forth to school on my Diamondback BMX bike. I‘d ride everywhere, whizzing down Ingleside Avenue, permanent smile glued to my face. I loved the freedom.\r\n \r\nFast forward thru some multi day road rides in high school + MTB adventures in college and things changed. I started several companies in my early twenties and logged countless hours as an architect working on the Pentagon renovation and other Department of Defense installations. With my sedentary lifestyle I packed on the pounds, until one day I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize myself. I weighed more than 270lbs. My doctor wanted to start me on cholesterol meds, said diet + exercise wouldn’t be enough. Don’t tell me what I can’t do.\r\n \r\nMy father surprised me with a road bike for my 31th birthday and over the next 18 months I dropped over 70lbs. All was well until a severe, debilitating case of Lyme disease interrupted my life and everything changed. For years I could barely speak or think clearly. Shut down the architecture firm, spent countless months on the couch, my weight ballooned.\r\n \r\nBut on my good days I would climb aboard my trusty Trek 5200 and bomb down into Patapsco. Ran into Pat + Adam training for RAAM in those days. Remember catching Pat’s wheel one day and hearing encouraging words. Never forgot those words. They gave me a glimmer of hope, that maybe one day things would be okay. And today they are. I’ve been miraculously healed of Lyme disease, married the girl of my dreams and am in the best shape of my life. I may never out climb you up Ilchester, but somehow managed to ride over 10,000mi this past year.\r\n \r\nThe bike is my sanctuary. It’s a rolling oasis of quiet times of reflection + intense fun with friends. Such a deep well of adventures, some in the rear view mirror, others just around the corner.","__v":0}

For my professional life, I teach yoga (my passion), and am a personal trainer and cycling coach.   I am blessed to be able to help others everyday with their cardio, flexibility, strength, body composition, balance, and injury rehabilitation through my work.  This year I turn 50 and I am celebrating by racing the road and track national championships, and the World Track Championships too!  I took 6th in the National individual road time trial and a 3rd at the track Nationals and will give my best at Worlds in mid-October in Los Angeles.","__v":0}

My wife and I enjoy riding and supporting cancer and diabetes fundraisers.  AFC is the perfect fit.","__v":0}
